# My Personal Project
## Phase 0

**Task 1**

The application that I propose is an **auction market**. It lets you add items to the auction market, and set a minimum 
bidding price. You can also set a timer that counts down to when the bid ends. In the end, you give the item to the 
customer with the highest bid. Before your item starts bidding, you also have the option to remove it. After an item
has been auctioned off, you add it to a list of the recently auctioned items where the list shows both the name of the 
item and the price it was auctioned off for.

**Task 2: Description**

What does this application do?

The application is essentially an auction market where the user is basically in charge of taking control. They are
responsible for keeping track of auctioning items, starting and managing bids, as well as keeping track if items
recently auctioned off. The features and functions of this auction market is very similar to an in person one.

Who will use it? 

Any person who has plans to hold auctions in the future but are skeptical about it. So, they use my auction market
simulation to get a feel of how it goes. That way, the person will have some knowledge and experience and will 
plan ahead.

Why is this project of interest to you?

I really want to know how auctioning works. Also, I want to determine whether bidding for an item gives a
much better deal than buying it directly. Also, I want to get more insight of the competitiveness of bidding.

**Task 3: User Stories**

- As a user, I want to be able to add and remove items from the auction market. 
- As a user, I want to be able to set a minimum bidding price to each item.
- As a user, I want to be able to set a timer to when the bid ends. 
- As a user, I want to be able to give the item to the person who won the bid, as well as obtain their bidding money
- As a user, I want to keep track of all items recently auctioned off, both the name and price of the item. 
- As a user, I want to keep track of the total money made from the auctions.
